#summary Clojure REPL Utils

= Target Tab Complete Features =

 * *(re-s TAB*  will show hint for all matched vars in current namespace *(complete)*
 * *(Class/for TAB* will show java hint for members such as forName
 * *(.. instance TAB * will show java hint for instance method
 * *(doto instance TAB * will show java hint for instance method
 
 with Tab Complete ASAP, the REPL will be much interesting.

= Other features =

= TODO =
 * rewrite the JLine ClojureCompletor with clojure, override the clojur/main.clj to automate dect the availabilty of JLine libraray, and enable JLine Tab Complete if possible. so we can still using java -jar clojure.jar to startup the REPL
 * add .repl.clj support, automated load the module for user defined initialize
 * add classpath operation such as (load-jar) to load a jar into classpath. so we no need to add it the launch script but in clojure script such as ".repl.clj"
